# What is ReBlock?
ReBlock is a CLI-based application that is what I call a "soft-jailbreak". It doesn't completely give you access to every part of the OS, but it opens up a lot of parts of it which allows you to do things that weren't intended to be done.

# Exploits & Tools
Tools such as [appUnblocker](https://github.com/yourworstnightmare1/appunblocker) and [packageExpander](https://github.com/yourworstnightmare1/packageexpander) are the base for ReBlock, and there's new stuff coming soon!
